## Customization Guide

### Change Colors

Edit `lib/theme/app_theme.dart`:

```dart
class AppColors {
  static const Color accent = Color(0xFFFF7F6A); // Change this!
  // ... other colors
}
```

### Add More Cooking Tips

Edit `lib/screens/loading_screen.dart`:

```dart
final List<String> _cookingTips = [
  'üí° Your new tip here!',
  // ... add more tips
];
```

### Modify Cuisine Types

Edit `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`:

```dart
final List<String> _cuisineTypes = [
  'Italian',
  'Your New Cuisine', // Add here
  // ...
];
```

### Change Recipe Icons

    'Italian': 'üçù',
    'YourCuisine': 'üçú', // Add here
    // ...
  };
}
```

## Integrating Real AI API

### Replace Mock Service

Edit `lib/services/recipe_service.dart`:

```dart
Future<Recipe> generateRecipe({
  required List<String> ingredients,
  String? cuisineType,
  List<String>? dietaryNeeds,
  String? mealType,
}) async {
  // Replace this mock implementation with your AI API call
  
  // Example with HTTP:
  // final response = await http.post(
  //   Uri.parse('YOUR_API_ENDPOINT'),
  //   body: jsonEncode({
  //     'ingredients': ingredients,
  //     'cuisine': cuisineType,
  //     'dietary': dietaryNeeds,
  //     'meal': mealType,
  //   }),
  // );
  // 
  // final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
  // return Recipe.fromJson(data);
  
  // Current mock implementation...
}
```

### Add HTTP Package

Update `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^1.1.0  # Add this
```

Then run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Fonts not loading
**Solution**: Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`

### Issue: App crashes on startup
**Solution**: Check Flutter version with `flutter --version`
Ensure you're using Flutter 3.9.2 or higher

### Issue: Hot reload not working
**Solution**: Stop the app and run `flutter run` again

### Issue: SharedPreferences not persisting
**Solution**: Check device storage permissions
On iOS: Ensure app has proper entitlements

### Issue: Slow performance
**Solution**: Run in release mode: `flutter run --release`

---

## Development Tips

### Hot Reload
Save your file or press `r` in terminal for hot reload
Press `R` for hot restart (clears state)

### Debug Mode
Run with debug flag:
```bash
flutter run --debug
```

### Release Mode (Faster)
```bash
flutter run --release
```

### View Logs
```bash
flutter logs
```

### Clear Data
To test empty states, clear app data:
- Android: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí PantryChef ‚Üí Clear Data
- iOS: Uninstall and reinstall app

---

## Building for Production

### Android APK
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### Android App Bundle (for Play Store)
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```
Output: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### iOS (Mac only)
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```
Then open Xcode and archive

- [ ] Test with no internet (should still work)
- [ ] Test save/delete functionality
- [ ] Test navigation flow
- [ ] Check for memory leaks
- [ ] Verify animations are smooth
- [ ] Test on both Android and iOS

---
