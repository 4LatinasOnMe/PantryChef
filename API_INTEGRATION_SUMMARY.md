# ✅ OpenAI API Integration Complete!

## What's Been Set Up

Your PantryChef app is now fully configured for OpenAI API integration. Here's what was done:

---

## 📦 Packages Added

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^1.1.0              # For API requests
  flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0    # For secure environment variables
```

---

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### ✅ New Files
1. **`.env`** - Your API key goes here (keep secret!)
2. **`.env.example`** - Template for reference
3. **`OPENAI_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide

### ✅ Modified Files
1. **`pubspec.yaml`** - Added dependencies & assets
2. **`.gitignore`** - Added `.env` to protect your API key
3. **`lib/main.dart`** - Loads environment variables on startup
4. **`lib/services/recipe_service.dart`** - Full OpenAI integration

---

## 🔑 What You Need to Do

### **ONLY ONE STEP:** Add Your API Key

1. Open the **`.env`** file in the project root
2. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key
3. Save the file

**Example:**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# 1. Install new packages
flutter pub get

# 2. Run the app
flutter run
```

**That's it!** The app will now generate real recipes using OpenAI.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Before (Mock)
```
User enters ingredients → Mock service generates fake recipe → Display
```

### Now (Real AI)
```
User enters ingredients → OpenAI API generates real recipe → Display
```

### What's Sent to OpenAI
- Your ingredients list
- Selected cuisine type
- Dietary needs
- Meal type
- Instructions for JSON format

### What OpenAI Returns
- Recipe title
- Description
- Prep & cook time
- Servings
- Ingredient list with measurements
- Step-by-step instructions

---

## 💰 Cost Information

Using **gpt-4o-mini** (recommended):
- ~$0.001 - $0.003 per recipe
- Generate 300-1000 recipes for $1
- Very affordable for personal use!

---

## 🛡️ Security Features

✅ API key stored in `.env` (not in code)
✅ `.env` excluded from Git (won't be committed)
✅ Environment variables loaded securely
✅ Clear error messages if key is missing
✅ Validation before API calls

---

## 🧪 Test It Out

1. **Get your OpenAI API key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Add it to `.env`**: Replace the placeholder
3. **Run the app**: `flutter pub get` then `flutter run`
4. **Generate a recipe**:
   - Enter: `chicken, tomatoes, pasta, garlic`
   - Select: Italian cuisine
   - Tap: Generate Recipe 🔥
5. **Wait 5-15 seconds**: OpenAI is creating your recipe
6. **View your AI-generated recipe!**

## ❌ Common Issues

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
→ Add your key to `.env` file

### "Invalid API key"
→ Check your key starts with `sk-` and is copied correctly

### "Rate limit exceeded"
→ Wait a few minutes, you've made too many requests

### "Network error"
→ Check your internet connection
